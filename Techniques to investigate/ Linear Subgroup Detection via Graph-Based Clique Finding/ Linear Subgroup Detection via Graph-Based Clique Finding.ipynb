    "### Method: Linear Subgroup Detection via Graph-Based Clique Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a novel graph-based algorithm to identify **linear subgroups** within a dataset. Unlike traditional clustering methods like K-Means or DBSCAN which find dense, spherical groups, this technique is specifically designed to detect sets of data points that are geometrically aligned (i.e., they lie on a straight line or a flat plane in the feature space).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works ⚙️\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm discovers these structures through a multi-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Pairwise Distances:** First, a distance matrix is computed for all pairs of points. It uses **Gower's distance** or other pairwise methods for distance to correctly handle datasets with a mix of numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Identify \"Flat\" Triangles:** The core of the method is a geometric test. For every possible triplet of points (i, j, k), it checks if the triangle they form is \"flat.\" A triangle is considered flat if its smallest height is less than a tiny threshold, `epsilon`. This is a proxy for determining if three points are nearly co-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Construct an Auxiliary Graph:** An auxiliary graph `G` is built where:\n",
    "    * The **nodes** are not the data points themselves, but every unique *pair* of data points (e.g., (i, j)).\n",
    "    * An **edge** is created between two nodes—say, `(i, j)` and `(j, k)`—if the points `i`, `j`, and `k` form a flat triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Find the Largest Clique:** The algorithm then finds the largest **clique** in this auxiliary graph. A clique is a subset of nodes where every node is connected to every other node. In this context, the largest clique represents the largest set of point-pairs that all form flat triangles with each other. The original data points involved in this clique form the final linear subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Method ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is highly specialized. It is most powerful in scenarios where you have a hypothesis that a subset of your data follows a simple, linear rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal use cases include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Progression Analysis:** Identifying subjects whose condition (e.g., disease progression) or behavior (e.g., product adoption) changes at a **constant, predictable rate** over time.\n",
    "* **Mixture/Formulation Data:** Finding the effect of systematically changing ingredient proportions in a mixture, such as in material science or chemical formulation, where results are expected to follow a linear trade-off.\n",
    "* **Rule Validation & Anomaly Detection:** In operational data (e.g., shipping logistics, finance), you can identify the subgroup that perfectly follows a known pricing or cost model. The data points *not* in this group are interesting anomalies worth investigating.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Consideration:** This method is sensitive to the `epsilon` parameter and is computationally expensive (O(n³)). It is best used for targeted exploration rather than general-purpose clustering."
