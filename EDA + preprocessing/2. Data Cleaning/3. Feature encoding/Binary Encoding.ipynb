    "# --- When to Use Binary Encoding ---\n",
    "# Binary encoding is a feature engineering technique used to transform categorical\n",
    "# variables into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# When to use it:\n",
    "# 1. High Cardinality Features: It's particularly effective for categorical\n",
    "#    features with a large number of unique values (e.g., zip codes, city names).\n",
    "# 2. Reducing Dimensionality: Compared to One-Hot Encoding, which creates a new\n",
    "#    column for each category, Binary Encoding creates far fewer columns,\n",
    "#    preventing the \"curse of dimensionality\".\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How it works:\n",
    "# 1. Categories are first converted to integers (like Ordinal Encoding).\n",
    "# 2. These integers are then converted into their binary representation.\n",
    "# 3. Each digit in the binary number gets its own column.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Requirements:\n",
    "# - The data must be categorical.\n",
    "# - It does not assume any order (ordinality) in the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. FIND AND LOAD A RELEVANT DATASET FROM SCIKIT-LEARN\n",
    "# We'll use the 'wine' dataset from scikit-learn. The 'target' column,\n",
    "# which represents different classes of wine, is a perfect candidate for encoding.\n",
    "wine_data = load_wine()\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data=wine_data.data, columns=wine_data.feature_names)\n",
    "# For demonstration, we'll use the 'target' column as our categorical feature.\n",
    "# In scikit-learn datasets, the target is often separate.\n",
    "df['wine_class'] = wine_data.target\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's see the original categories\n",
    "print(\"Original unique categories in 'wine_class':\")\n",
    "print(df['wine_class'].unique())\n",
    "print(\"\\nValue counts of original categories:\")\n",
    "print(df['wine_class'].value_counts())\n",
    "print(\"-\" * 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. SELECT A FEATURE TO WORK WITH\n",
    "# We will apply binary encoding to the 'wine_class' column.\n",
    "feature_to_encode = 'wine_class'\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. APPLY THE BINARY ENCODING\n",
    "# We initialize the BinaryEncoder from the category_encoders library.\n",
    "# We specify the column we want to encode in the `cols` parameter.\n",
    "binary_encoder = ce.BinaryEncoder(cols=[feature_to_encode])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the encoder to the data and transform the column.\n",
    "# The `fit_transform` method learns the categories and then converts them.\n",
    "df_encoded = binary_encoder.fit_transform(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. SHOW THE RESULT\n",
    "# The encoder replaces the original 'wine_class' column with new binary columns.\n",
    "# Let's rename the new columns for clarity.\n",
    "new_column_names = {col: f\"{feature_to_encode}_{col.split('_')[-1]}\" for col in df_encoded.columns if col.startswith(f\"{feature_to_encode}_\")}\n",
    "df_encoded.rename(columns=new_column_names, inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# For clarity, let's join the original column back to see the mapping.\n",
    "# We'll create a final DataFrame for comparison.\n",
    "final_df = df.join(df_encoded.filter(like=feature_to_encode))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nHead of the DataFrame after Binary Encoding:\")\n",
    "# Displaying the original and the new encoded columns side-by-side\n",
    "print(final_df[[feature_to_encode] + list(new_column_names.values())].head(10))\n",
    "print(\"-\" * 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's see the full mapping for all unique values\n",
    "print(\"\\nFull mapping of original categories to binary representation:\")\n",
    "print(\n",
    "    final_df[[feature_to_encode] + list(new_column_names.values())]\n",

    "# 5. VISUALIZATION\n",
    "# A traditional before-and-after histogram (like for log transform) isn't\n",
    "# directly applicable to binary encoding. The goal isn't to change the\n",
    "# distribution of a single variable, but to represent categories numerically.\n",
    "# A good \"visualization\" is to show the value counts before and the resulting\n",
    "# table after, which we've printed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "# However, we can create a plot to visualize the original distribution of categories.\n",

    "ax.set_xlabel('Wine Class Category', fontsize=12)\n",
    "ax.set_ylabel('Count', fontsize=12)\n",
    "plt.tight_layout()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# The \"after\" visualization is effectively the table printed above, which shows\n",
    "# how each category is now represented by a vector of binary digits (0s and 1s).\n"
